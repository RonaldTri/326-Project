# CECS 326 Lab 2: Concurrent RPG Game (Shared Memory & Semaphores)

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements an **RPG-based game** using **concurrent processing** on a POSIX (Unix/Linux) system. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with **inter-process communication (IPC)** via **shared memory** and **process synchronization** using **semaphores**.

The game features four distinct processes: a central **Dungeon** process that manages game state, and three character processes ‚Äì a **Barbarian**, a **Wizard**, and a **Rogue** ‚Äì which interact with the dungeon through shared memory and signals.

## ‚ú® Features & Technologies Demonstrated

* **Concurrent Programming:** Design and execution of multiple co-existing processes (`fork()`, `exec()`).
* **Shared Memory (System V IPC):** Implemented a central `Dungeon` struct in shared memory to allow real-time communication and state updates between all game processes.
* **Semaphores:** Utilized named semaphores (`sem_wait`, `sem_post`) to coordinate access to critical sections, specifically to "hold" a door open for the Rogue character.
* **Signal Handling:** Configured robust signal handlers (`sigaction`) for each character process to react to game events without crashing.
* **Algorithmic Problem-Solving:**
    * **Caesar Cipher Decoder:** Implemented a decoder for the Wizard character to solve a spell puzzle.
    * **Binary Search:** Utilized a binary search algorithm for the Rogue character to efficiently "pick" a lock by guessing a floating-point value.
* **Makefile:** Managed the compilation and linking of all C source files and provided object files.
* **Environment:** Developed and tested on a Linux virtual machine (POSIX system).

## üéÆ Game Play Overview

In this RPG, players control three characters attempting to navigate a dungeon:
* **Barbarian:** Attacks enemies by mirroring health values, demonstrating direct shared memory interaction.
* **Wizard:** Decodes Caesar ciphers to solve magical barriers.
* **Rogue:** Picks complex locks using a binary search approach to find a precise value.

The final challenge involves the Barbarian and Wizard cooperating with semaphores to allow the Rogue to safely acquire treasure from a locked room.
